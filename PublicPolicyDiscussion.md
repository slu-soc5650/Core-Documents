## Instructions for Discussion Leaders
There is a specific Slack channel for each assigned week. Discussion leaders should post 1 or 2 discussion questions per case study by the Friday prior to their assigned date. Discussion questions should prompt the rest of the class to respond to the ways that GIS data were used, the effectiveness of their use, and possible shortcomings or challenges to their use. Try to tailor the questions specifically to each case study - i.e. do not ask broad questions like "what was the case study about?".

## Instructions for the Class
All class members are expected to interact with each of the weekly Slack channels. Your responses can take the form of:
  - a direct response to or answer to one of the questions or
  - a follow-up question or a clarifying question that respond directly to the original questions posted by the discussion leader.
