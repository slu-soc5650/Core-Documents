## Instructions for the Class
All class members are expected to interact with each of the weekly Slack channels. Your responses can take the form of:
  - a direct response to or answer to one of the questions or
  - a follow-up question or a clarifying question that respond directly to the original questions posted by the discussion leader.

Using the ability to "thread" discussions on Slack, you should also respond to at least two of your peers. These responses can take on the form of a comment, a possible answer, or a follow-up question. If responses are made to your question, please take the time to respond back!

### Discussion Questions
There is a specific Slack channel for each assigned week. Discussion leaders should post 1 or 2 discussion questions per case study by the Thursday evening prior to their assigned date. Discussion questions should prompt the rest of the class to respond to the ways that GIS data were used, the effectiveness of their use, and possible shortcomings or challenges to their use. Try to tailor the questions specifically to each case study - i.e. do not ask broad questions like "what was the case study about?".

### Class Discussion
After submissions have been made on Slack, the discussion leader should read through questions / comments and synthesize them. Discussion leaders should come to class prepared to (1) give a brief overview of the case studies themselves, (2) summarize what your classmates' thoughts and questions were, and (3) solicit your classmates' perspectives on the case study. These discussions should last approximately 15 minutes.
